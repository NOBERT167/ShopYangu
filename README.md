# Product and Shop Management System 

## Description

ShopYangu is a web application built with **React** and **Next.js** that allows users to manage products and shops. The system features a product listing, a form for adding and editing products, and displays the associated shop for each product. The app utilizes **Axios** for API requests and **React Toastify** for notifications. Users can also add new shops, delete products, and update product details, all with real-time data from the server.

## Key Features

- **Product Management**: Add, edit, delete, and view product details.
- **Shop Management**: Display shop names associated with products with all crud operations to add, delete and edit shops.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- **Modern Ui/UX Design**: A clean modern UI/UX with light and darkmode.
- **Currency Formatting**: Product prices are formatted with commas for better readability (e.g., `10,000`).
- **Toast Notifications**: Real-time notifications for success and error messages.
- **API Integration**: Fetches data from a Mock API(json server) for products and shops using **Axios**.
